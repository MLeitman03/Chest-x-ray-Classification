## How do computers see images?
- Computers break images down into little pixels  and gives each pixel a numerical value
- A computer sees an  image as 0s and 1s
- Greyscale-  a range of grey shades from white to black
- Each pixel value would be an integer between 0 and 255 (0 is black, 255 is white)

## What is a CNN?
- A CNN is a Convolutional Neural Network, mainly used for image and speech classifications.
- It uses matrices to process and simplify images, and then use them to make predictions.

## Project goal
- Use a CNN to identify and classify human disease

## Model metrics

- Model error: the difference between the predicted output of the model and the actual output

- Model accuracy: the ratio of the number of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances in the data
